**C LIFE**

This thing is my first c project, i wanted to try coding in c and Conway Game of life was my inspiration, J.H. Conway is a big inspiration for me i really like all the work/ research that he have done for his game.

Also this project initiate me to code with Nvim

In first i started to display the game in the terminal but after seeing some graphic library, i have done an approximatly working sdl2 implement.
